            <div>There is already an esports shop in the game where players can buy decals of professional teams. This was a no-brainer to include because fans already love buying decals even if they don&#x27;t support the team. IÂ also didn&#x27;t include fan rewards. Currently, if players link their twitch accounts to Rocket League, they can get in-game items for watching streams.</div>

            <div class="finald-explained">Not many people in the scene know what Cup, Open, and Invitational mean. By including Regional 1, 2, 3 directly underneath it - people can easily tell itâs regional 3/3 which means itâs important because the Major is next and people are fighting for qualification.</div>
            <div class="finald-explained">Accessing the tournament page happens through this bar and when you visit the page, North America is automatically selected which gives easy access to those who already plan on going to the tournament page, since it will probably have high traffic.

            <div class="finald-explained">Like mentioned earlier, one of the main goals of this hub was to showcase the high level of RLCS. Low level casual players are very impressed by skills of pros who have thousands and thousands of hours in the game. By giving access to not only the level of play, but the hype that comes with watching them and listening to the commentators, people can start to take an interest.</div>
            <div class="finald-explained">For those that do keep up with RLCS, there is a poll to keep fans thinking about whatâs going on and potentially spark discussion on Reddit and Twitter - where most of the discussion happens. This can create a link to draw casual fans to the forms of social media where a lot of other stuff happens.</div>

      <h2>Testing an interactive prototype didn&#x27;t reveal many additional insights</h2>
      <div>After the design was complete visually, I added interactive capability through Figmaâs prototype tools to test its navigation through a controller. I wanted to test the navigation digitally rather than with a physical prototype to test peopleâs initial reactions with button input. I felt like people would have too much time to think about what they would press with a physical prototype, that people might incorrectly guess which button theyâd actually press once itâs on a screen.<br><br>Testing with Figma didnât go as smoothly because the prototype was slow on a couple peopleâs computers so there was an even longer delay between inputs. <strong>The one main thing I realized I needed to reconsider was what selections were grouped together vs individual.</strong></div><img src="images/image16.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 94vw, (max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" srcset="images/image16-p-500.png 500w, images/image16-p-800.png 800w, images/image16-p-1080.png 1080w, images/image16-p-1600.png 1600w, images/image16.png 1666w" alt="" class="image-24">
      <div>For example, when navigating, the entire Region Leaders box would be selected, and upon pressing select, it would move to an individual box for NA. However, vertical navigation isnât interrupted by the initial step being taken out because thereâs only left and right selections.Â <br><br>Other than that, there were no real complaints which is understandable based on the design. Itâs not complex at all, and would take very little getting used to if it reacted instantly in a game engine.Â Â </div>

      <div>A long time after I actually designed the screens, I posted the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/1824hf8/an_idea_of_what_an_ingame_interface_could_look/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" class="link-2">UI concept on the Rocket League Esports subreddit</a>. Here are some of the comments from the post.</div>

        <div class="darkmode">Looking back, I made this project much more difficult than it needed to be. I had lots of ideas in the beginning of what I could do, but never settled on moving forward with something, and went back and forth on minor details. It ended up hindering the amount of stuff I could cover. I wanted to make a bigger ecosystem for the in-game menus, but it was hard to choose what was worth my time and what wasnât - not just because of what would be effective, but things that initially seemed too simple. For example, I know that pressing on the stats would lead you to another screen where you can explore them more in-depth. However, I didnât make it because Iâve seen so many successful statistics done on websites I didnât feel it was necessary to try and make one here. <br><br><strong>It also makes me think about how I probably made this too similar to a website.</strong> This was designed for a video game, so it has the freedom to be a lot more interesting than what I made. Iâm happy with the UI matching Rocket Leagueâs theme, but I donât know if it matches the mechanics of menu functionality quite the way it should. I wish I made things a bit more fun and over the top by expanding each section more and adding more spice. The problem I figured with that is it starts to involve more graphic design which isnât my specialty. I think if I was more comfortable with higher fidelity sketches, that concept would come easier which is something that might be a learning goal for the future.Â </div>
