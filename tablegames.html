We wanted to make it easier for groups to bond easily with each other through light-hearted conversation - especially those where everyone didn’t know each other too well.<br><br>Our team initially focused on altering the board game experience to use tangible user interfaces, but we felt trying to force technology into something like a board game would detract from the experience that makes a board game special - the physical aspects and lack of technology.</div>

          <div class="h2-2">Animation Game</div>
          <div class="body-2"><strong>How it works:</strong> This is inspired by the game <a href="https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com">We’re Not Really Strangers</a>, which is a card game with discussion prompts that spark conversation and connect. Basically, we modified that style of game to work on a tangible table rather than using cards. How this would work is that the user lifts their napkin to reveal a conversation prompt on the table beneath it. If they feel uncomfortable answering the questions or would simply prefer a different one, they can put their napkin back on the table and pick it up again to refresh the prompt</div>
          <div class="div-block-7"><img src="images/image32.png" loading="lazy" id="w-node-abf0ad67-f643-d027-d9b5-a5ab5d7a810c-be3158f5" alt=""><img src="images/image20.png" loading="lazy" id="w-node-abf0ad67-f643-d027-d9b5-a5ab5d7a810d-be3158f5" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 27vw, (max-width: 767px) 29vw, (max-width: 991px) 165.3359375px, 236px" srcset="images/image20-p-500.png 500w, images/image20.png 662w" alt=""><img src="images/image31.png" loading="lazy" id="w-node-abf0ad67-f643-d027-d9b5-a5ab5d7a810e-be3158f5" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 27vw, (max-width: 767px) 29vw, (max-width: 991px) 165.3359375px, 236px" srcset="images/image31-p-500.png 500w, images/image31.png 550w" alt="">

          </div>
          <div class="body-2"><strong>Why it works:</strong> The animation game serves as a natural icebreaker. Because this game is meant for people that might not all know each other, conversation gets focused on the game itself rather than awkward small talk such as asking how people’s days have been and talking about themselves. <br><br>Everyone can put their own unique twist on the game when the frame gets to them, and with it being easy to participate, people have a sense of belonging. Because this is a fun activity, dinner guests are warmed up to each other for our next game which is more serious and involves deeper conversation.</div>

          <div class="body-2"><strong>Why it works:</strong> Since the dinner guests will feel a little more comfortable around each other through the first activity, we hope this game will strengthen those connections by sparking unexpected conversations and build relationships with one another through prompted questions and activities. Also, elevating mealtime activities is a way to mutually unite and create a sense of belonging within a community (Oxford, 2017).<br></div>

        <div class="darkmode">Most of the time we end up designing for a set user group that has certain characteristics, but this time we designed for a certain context that really could fit with anyone which made it engaging to design for. Usually in our program, we do a lot of testing with other students when our user group isn&#x27;t anything close to UX students. This contrast made our testing results much more meaningful because it felt like we actually designed something interesting and the group of four we tested with genuinely enjoyed it. <br><br><br>This was also the first project I&#x27;ve worked on where our outcome was just making something that was fun. We work on so many projects where our goal is to solve some type of problem which made it nice to change it up. After all, one of my making design fun, so this was project was super fulfilling to see potential in. </div>
